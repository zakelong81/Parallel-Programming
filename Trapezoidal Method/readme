Report Number of Trapezoidal

Number of trap 43410500
ARTE: 4.9740779554592725829e-15

I applied Trapezoidal Rule to approximate the area under the curve of the
function.

I keep increase the number of trap by 1000000 each run until the current error
is higher than 0.5e-14.

Then I reversed to the last number of trap that run and reduce the increasement
by divine by 10 until the increasement is 1 and it stop.

It took around 25-30 mins to run if I start at 1. It gets slower that the end
since the number is very big, and it must keep repeating that very big number

What I found interesting is that sometime increase the number of trap is also
increase ARTE. I realized that you can either underestimate or overestimate.
